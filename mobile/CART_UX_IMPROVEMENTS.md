# Cart UX Improvements

## Problem
Previously, when users clicked the plus (+) or minus (-) buttons to adjust item quantities in the cart, a network request was sent immediately and the entire cart showed a loading state. This created a poor user experience with:
- Slow, unresponsive UI
- Loading indicators blocking user interaction
- No immediate feedback for user actions

## Solution
Implemented **optimistic UI updates** with **debounced API calls** to create a smooth, responsive experience.

### Key Improvements

#### 1. **Optimistic UI Updates**
- Quantity changes are reflected immediately in the UI
- Cart total is recalculated instantly
- No waiting for network requests

#### 2. **Debounced API Calls**
- Network requests are delayed by 500ms after the last quantity change
- Multiple rapid clicks are batched into a single API call
- Reduces server load and improves performance

#### 3. **Per-Item Loading States**
- Only the specific item being synced shows a loading indicator
- Small, subtle progress indicator in the corner of the quantity display
- Other items remain fully interactive

#### 4. **Error Handling with Rollback**
- If an API call fails, the cart state is automatically reverted
- Users see an error message via SnackBar
- No data loss or inconsistent states

#### 5. **Smart Button States**
- Plus/minus buttons are disabled only during actual API calls
- Prevents conflicting operations on the same item
- Visual feedback shows when buttons are temporarily disabled

#### 6. **Global Sync Indicator**
- Small progress indicator next to "Total" when any items are syncing
- Users know when background operations are happening
- Non-intrusive and informative

### Technical Implementation

#### CartProvider Updates
- Added `_pendingUpdates` Map to track debounced timers per item
- Added `_itemUpdatingStatus` Map to track which items are being updated
- Added `isItemUpdating(itemId)` method for per-item status checks
- Added `hasUpdatingItems` getter for global status
- Improved `updateQuantity()` method with optimistic updates and rollback

#### UI Updates
- Updated `ShoppingCartItem` to show per-item loading states
- Added context parameter to API calls for error feedback
- Updated `CartContent` to show global sync indicator
- Disabled interactions only when necessary

### Benefits
1. **Instant Responsiveness**: UI updates immediately, no waiting
2. **Reduced Server Load**: Multiple clicks batched into single requests
3. **Better Error Handling**: Automatic rollback with user feedback
4. **Non-blocking UX**: Users can continue interacting with other items
5. **Clear Feedback**: Users know exactly what's happening and when

### Usage
The improvements are automatic and require no changes to existing usage patterns. Users will immediately notice:
- Faster quantity adjustments
- Smoother interactions
- Better feedback when things go wrong
- No more blocking loading states
