# FreshK Project Improvements Summary

## Project Overview

FreshK is a Django-based e-commerce platform designed to connect retailers with suppliers of fresh products. The platform uses Django REST Framework for API development and JWT for authentication.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Critical Priority Issues

#### Security Vulnerabilities
- **Hardcoded Secret Key**: Moved Django SECRET_KEY from settings.py to environment variables
- **Exposed Database Credentials**: Moved database credentials to environment variables
- **Insufficient Authentication Controls**: Implemented proper role-based permissions

#### Core Business Logic
- **Missing Stock Management**: Implemented automatic stock updates when orders are placed
- **Incomplete Order Flow**: Added order status transitions and validation
- **Missing Transaction Handling**: Added transaction support for critical operations

### High Priority Issues

#### Search and Filtering
- **No Search Functionality**: Implemented search for products by name, description, and SKU
- **Missing Filtering**: Added filtering by category, supplier, price, etc.
- **No Pagination**: Configured pagination for all list endpoints

#### User Management
- **Incomplete Authentication**: Added email verification and password reset
- **Missing Validation**: Enhanced validation for user registration and profile updates

#### Data Validation
- **Insufficient Validation**: Added validators for critical fields (price, quantity, etc.)
- **Missing Cross-Field Validation**: Implemented clean methods for complex validation

### Medium Priority Issues

#### Shopping Cart
- **No Cart Functionality**: Implemented complete shopping cart system
- **Missing Checkout Process**: Created seamless cart-to-order checkout flow

## Implemented Solutions

### Security Enhancements

```python
# Before
SECRET_KEY = 'django-insecure-*5-uq5pyf(*%&1s&sx^-dz$)n=w$rx(682(=xl*eu$_510mtly'

# After
from decouple import config
SECRET_KEY = config('SECRET_KEY', default='django-insecure-*5-uq5pyf(*%&1s&sx^-dz$)n=w$rx(682(=xl*eu$_510mtly')
```

- Created `.env` file for storing sensitive configuration
- Added python-decouple for environment variable management
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files

### Permission System

- Created custom permission classes:
  - `IsAdmin`, `IsRetailer`, `IsSupplier`
  - `IsAdminOrSupplier`, `IsAdminOrRetailer`
  - `IsOwnerOrAdmin`

- Applied appropriate permissions to all ViewSets:
```python
class ProductViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Product.objects.all()
    serializer_class = ProductSerializer
    
    def get_permissions(self):
        if self.action in ['create', 'update', 'partial_update', 'destroy']:
            return [IsAdminOrSupplier()]
        return [IsAuthenticated()]
```

### Search and Filtering

- Added Django Filter Backend for all ViewSets
- Configured search fields for relevant models
- Implemented ordering options
- Added pagination with a default page size

```python
# Global configuration in settings.py
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS': [
        'django_filters.rest_framework.DjangoFilterBackend',
        'rest_framework.filters.SearchFilter',
        'rest_framework.filters.OrderingFilter',
    ],
    'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS': 'rest_framework.pagination.PageNumberPagination',
    'PAGE_SIZE': 20,
}

# View-specific configuration
class ProductViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    filter_backends = [DjangoFilterBackend, SearchFilter, OrderingFilter]
    filterset_fields = ['category', 'supplier', 'price']
    search_fields = ['name', 'description', 'sku']
    ordering_fields = ['name', 'price', 'stock_quantity']
```

### User Management

- Implemented email verification for new registrations
- Added password reset functionality
- Enhanced user serializers with proper validation

```python
class RegisterSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    password = serializers.CharField(write_only=True, required=True, min_length=8)
    email = serializers.EmailField(required=True)

    def validate_email(self, value):
        if CustomUser.objects.filter(email=value).exists():
            raise serializers.ValidationError("A user with this email already exists.")
        return value

    def validate_password(self, value):
        validate_password(value)
        return value
```

### Data Validation

- Added validators to model fields:
```python
price = models.DecimalField(
    max_digits=10, 
    decimal_places=2,
    validators=[MinValueValidator(0.01, message="Price must be greater than zero")]
)
```

- Implemented custom validators for images and other fields
- Added database indexes for performance optimization

### Shopping Cart Implementation

- Created Cart and CartItem models
- Implemented cart API endpoints:
  - Add/remove items
  - Update quantities
  - Clear cart
  - Checkout

- Added validation for stock availability during cart operations
- Implemented transaction-based checkout process

## Code Structure Improvements

- Added helpful properties and methods to models

### API Improvements
