# Order Detail Screen - Modular Architecture

This directory contains a refactored, modular version of the OrderDetailScreen that separates concerns into individual, reusable components.

## Components Overview

### Main Screen (`order_detail_screen.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates all components and handles state management
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Layout coordination
  - Data calculation (subtotal, charges, discounts)
  - Action handlers (copy, cancel, reorder)
- **Size**: ~200 lines (down from 1,382 lines)

### Extensions (`extensions/order_extensions.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Add formatting and utility methods to the Order model
- **Features**:
  - Date formatting
  - Status colors and payment status
  - Payment method formatting

### Widget Components

#### `OrderStatusCard`
- Displays current order status with icon and color coding
- Shows status display name and last updated date

#### `OrderTimeline` 
- Visual progress indicator for order stages
- Handles normal flow and cancelled/returned states

#### `PaymentDetailsCard`
- Payment method, status, and transaction information
- Includes refund information for cancelled orders

#### `DeliveryAddressCard`
- Shows delivery/shipping address
- Handles missing address gracefully
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality

#### `ProductCard`
- Individual product item display
- Uses new CartItem fields (formatted prices, units)
- Responsive image loading

#### `OrderSummaryCard`
- Order totals, charges, and discounts
- Item count display
- Profit margin information

#### `ActionButtons`
- Cancel and reorder functionality
- Conditional display based on order status

#### `CommonWidgets`
- Reusable components: SectionTitle, DetailCard, DetailRow, NotesSection
- Consistent styling and behavior

## Benefits of Modular Architecture

### 1. **Maintainability**
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Easy to locate and modify specific functionality
- Reduced cognitive load when working on individual features

### 2. **Reusability** 
- Components can be reused in other screens
- Consistent UI patterns across the app
- Easy to create variations of existing components

### 3. **Testability**
- Each widget can be tested in isolation
- Mock data can be easily provided to individual components
- Reduced complexity in unit tests

### 4. **Readability**
- Main screen file is now clean and easy to understand
- Component purposes are clear from their names
- Logical separation of concerns

### 5. **Scalability**
- Easy to add new sections or modify existing ones
- Components can be enhanced independently
- New developers can quickly understand the structure

## Usage Example

```dart
// Using individual components
OrderStatusCard(order: order, scale: scale)

// Using in main screen
OrderDetailScreen(order: orderData)
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each widget has one clear purpose
2. **Dependency Injection**: Data flows down through constructor parameters
3. **Consistent Naming**: Clear, descriptive names for all components
4. **Proper Imports**: Clean import structure with index file
5. **Documentation**: Clear comments and README documentation
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing/null data
7. **Responsive Design**: Consistent scaling across all components

## Migration Notes

- All functionality from the original 1,382-line file is preserved
- No breaking changes to the public API
- Improved handling of new Order model fields
- Better null safety throughout

This modular approach makes the codebase more maintainable and sets a good pattern for other complex screens in the application.
