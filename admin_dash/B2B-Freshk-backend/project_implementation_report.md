# FreshK Platform Enhancement Implementation Report

## Project Overview

The FreshK platform has been enhanced to serve two distinct purposes:

1. **Mobile App Backend**: Providing endpoints for a Flutter mobile app storefront
2. **Admin Dashboard Backend**: Supporting an admin interface for store management and analytics

This report details the implementation of Phase 1 of the action plan, focusing on authentication system enhancements and mobile API development.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Authentication System Enhancement

#### 1.1 User Model Enhancement

The `CustomUser` model has been extended to support phone-based authentication:

```python
# Phone number validation
phone_regex = RegexValidator(
    regex=r'^\+?1?\d{9,15}$',
    message="Phone number must be entered in the format: '+999999999'. Up to 15 digits allowed."
)
phone_number = models.CharField(
    validators=[phone_regex],
    max_length=17,
    unique=True,
    null=True,
    blank=True,
    help_text="Phone number in international format"
)
phone_verified = models.BooleanField(default=False)

# For OTP verification
otp = models.CharField(max_length=6, blank=True, null=True)
otp_expiry = models.DateTimeField(blank=True, null=True)
```

Database indexes were added to optimize queries:

```python
class Meta:
    indexes = [
        models.Index(fields=['phone_number']),
        models.Index(fields=['role']),
    ]
```

#### 1.2 OTP Generation and Verification

A utility module (`utils.py`) was created to handle OTP operations:

- `generate_otp()`: Creates random 6-digit OTP codes
- `is_otp_valid()`: Validates OTP against stored value and expiry time
- `send_otp_via_sms()`: Sends OTP via Twilio SMS (with fallback for development)
- `set_user_otp()`: Generates and stores OTP with expiry time

#### 1.3 Authentication Serializers

New serializers were implemented to support phone-based authentication:

- `PhoneVerificationRequestSerializer`: For requesting OTP verification
- `PhoneVerificationConfirmSerializer`: For confirming OTP
- `PhoneLoginSerializer`: For phone-based login
- `CustomTokenObtainPairSerializer`: For JWT token generation with role claims

#### 1.4 Authentication Views

The `UserViewSet` was enhanced with new actions:

- `phone_verification_request`: Sends OTP to user's phone
- `phone_verification_confirm`: Verifies OTP and marks phone as verified
- `phone_login`: Authenticates user with phone number and OTP
- `password_reset_request`: Supports both email and phone-based reset
- `password_reset_confirm`: Resets password using OTP as token

### 2. Mobile App API Development

#### 2.1 Mobile-Specific Authentication

A dedicated mobile authentication flow was implemented:

- `phone_auth_request`: Combined registration/login flow based on phone number
- `phone_auth_verify`: OTP verification with automatic user activation

#### 2.2 Mobile-Optimized Serializers

Simplified serializers were created for the mobile app:

- `MobileUserSerializer`: Minimal user data for mobile display
- `MobileProductSerializer`: Product data with formatted prices in TND
- `MobileProductCategorySerializer`: Categories with product counts
- `MobileCartSerializer`: Cart with formatted totals and item counts
- `MobileOrderSerializer`: Orders with status display and formatted totals

#### 2.3 Mobile-Specific ViewSets

Dedicated ViewSets were implemented for mobile app functionality:

- `MobileProductViewSet`: Product browsing with search and category filtering
- `MobileCategoryViewSet`: Category browsing
- `MobileCartViewSet`: Cart management with add/remove/update operations
- `MobileOrderViewSet`: Order history and details

#### 2.4 Cash on Delivery Implementation

The mobile checkout process was optimized for Cash on Delivery:

```python
@action(detail=False, methods=['post'])
def checkout(self, request):
    """Convert cart to order"""
    cart = self.get_object()
    
    # Create order
    order = Order.objects.create(
        user=request.user,
        total_amount=cart.total_amount,
        status='pending',  # Default status for COD
        payment_method='cash_on_delivery'
    )
    
    # Create order items
    for cart_item in cart.items.all():
        OrderItem.objects.create(
            order=order,
            product=cart_item.product,
            quantity=cart_item.quantity,
            price=cart_item.product.price
        )
    
    # Clear cart
    cart.items.all().delete()
    cart.total_amount = 0
    cart.save()
    
    return Response(
        MobileOrderSerializer(order).data,
        status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED
    )
```

### 3. URL Structure Optimization

#### 3.1 Mobile API Endpoints

A dedicated URL namespace was created for mobile endpoints:

```python
# Mobile app endpoints
path('api/mobile/', include('apps.mobile.urls')),
```

Mobile-specific URLs were organized by functionality:

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('', include(router.urls)),
    # Authentication endpoints
    path('auth/request/', phone_auth_request, name='mobile-auth-request'),
    path('auth/verify/', phone_auth_verify, name='mobile-auth-verify'),
]
```

#### 3.2 Admin Dashboard Endpoints

Admin endpoints were clearly separated from mobile endpoints:

```python
# Admin dashboard endpoints
path('api/users/', include('apps.users.urls')),
path('api/products/', include('apps.products.urls')),
path('api/orders/', include('apps.orders.urls')),
path('api/inventory/', include('apps.inventory.urls')),
path('api/analytics/', include('apps.analytics.urls')),
path('api/cart/', include('apps.cart.urls')),
```

## Technical Debt and Future Improvements

1. **Database Migrations**: Migrations need to be created and applied for the updated user model.

2. **Admin Dashboard Enhancements**: 
   - Implement order status management views
   - Create product and category management interfaces

3. **Analytics Visualization**:
   - Enhance dashboard views for sales and performance metrics
   - Create mobile-specific analytics endpoints

4. **Testing**:
   - Add unit tests for authentication flows
   - Create integration tests for mobile endpoints

## Conclusion

The implementation of Phase 1 has successfully established the foundation for supporting both a Flutter mobile app and an admin dashboard. The authentication system now handles both phone-based and username/password authentication, while the mobile API provides optimized endpoints for the Flutter app.

The next phase will focus on enhancing the admin dashboard functionality, particularly for order management and analytics visualization.
